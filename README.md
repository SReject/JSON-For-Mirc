JSON For mIRC
===
> A script to parse and then access JSON from within mIRC.  
>
> "But Mr. Reject, there's plenty of these scripts! Why create another?" Well, little one, I find that most of those scripts trade in efficiency for simplicity. Generally speaking most JSON scripts for mIRC reparse the json data each time that data needs to be accessed.  
>
> My version, though a bit more complex to understand, only requires the parsing of JSON data once per JSON handler instance, making it quite a bit faster and less resource intensive to use. Along with being a bit more efficient handling JSON, the script can retrieve data from remote sources for parsing. Allowing for the request method and headers to be set as needed.  
>
> "But why a JSON parser? Why not spend your time coding something that the typical user would make use of?". Its simple, to make those fancy GUI-intensive scripts, scripters need/use tools to simplify the tasks. This is one such tool.  
>
> The reason for a JSON parser vs. some other 'tool' is because of its overwhelming use around the web. Now-a-days, when you want data from a website they probably package it as an API that generally returns results in JSON format. Examples include: Google.com, Youtube.com, Pastebin.com, and Weather.com
